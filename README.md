* **Inline elements** take only the width they need and do not start on a new line. Examples: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`.



### 17. What is the `<div>` tag used for?

* The `<div>` tag is a **block-level container** used to group other HTML elements.
* It has **no semantic meaning** by itself but is used to apply CSS styles or manipulate groups of elements with JavaScript.

* The `<span>` tag is an **inline container** used to group inline elements.
* Like `<div>`, it has no semantic meaning but is useful for styling or scripting parts of text without breaking the flow.
